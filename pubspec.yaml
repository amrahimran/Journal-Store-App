# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

      fonts:
        - asset: assets\fonts\Chewy-Regular.ttf

    - family: MontserratRegular
      fonts:
